# Introduction
The CN-Lab-Gait-Dataset is the collection of gait datasets used in research for gait technology. 
The Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT), Thammasat  University (TU), has copyright in the Gait Datasets for the entire gait video and associated data.


# CN-Lab-Gait-Dataset

### Dataset SIIT-CN-A
The SIIT-CN-A is free-direction (freestyle walks), single-camera data that are collected from 91 users. 
A Kinect V1 device is placed in a room with a height of 240 cm above the floor. The Kinect was tilted down with an angle of 27 degrees. 
Each user was asked to walk freely for 10 rounds in their usual way. The duration is from 30 to 60 seconds for each walk.

### Dataset SIIT-CN-B
The SIIT-CN-A is free-direction (freestyle walks), single-camera data that are collected from 393 users.
A Kinect V1 device is placed in a room with a height of 235 cm above the floor. The Kinect was tilted down with an angle of 27 degrees. With a distance from the front of the camera of 125 cm, we provided a rectangle of 355 cm by 250 cm.
Each user was asked to walk freely for 12 rounds in their usual way. The duration is from 30 to 60 seconds for each walk.

### Dataset SIIT-CN-C
The SIIT-CN-C is free-direction (freestyle walks), multi-angle data that are collected from 130 users. Gait data of a person are collected from 4 different settings. 
In Setting 1 to 4, a camera is placed at the height of 235, 185, 150, and 100 cm from the floor with angles of 27, 20, 10, and 0 degrees tilted down from the horizontal line parallel to the floor, respectively.
With a distance from the front of the camera of 125 cm, we provided a rectangle of 355 cm by 250 cm. 
Each user was asked to walk freely for 12 rounds.
Round 1 to 6 for setting 1 and 3 and round 7 to 12 for setting 2 and 4.
The duration is from 30 to 60 seconds for each walk.

***\*We note that the subjects in SIIT-CN-A, SIIT-CN-B, and SIIT-CN-C are unique.***

### Dataset SIIT-CN-D
We used the combined gait data from three different datasets, SIIT-CN-A (91 users), SIIT-CN-B (393 users), and SIIT-CN-C (130 users). In all three datasets, participants were asked to walk freely, in any direction, where multiple Kinects were placed at different heights and angles. Each captured video is at least 30 seconds long. 

We create a new gait dataset, called SIIT-CN-D, from these three datasets by splitting the original capture videos into many 2-second (40 frames) videos. The SIIT-CN-D dataset consists of 180,097 2-second walks from 610 random unique subjects with different heights, weights, and genders. These 2-second walks are captured by different camera angles and heights from the ground.
